# BOT BATTLR REACT WEB APP

BY WALTER DAVID IRUNGU

## DESCRIPTION

BOT BATTLR is an interactive web application where users can view, select, and manage a collection of bots. The application allows users to create their own bot army, view detailed bot stats, and manage their selection. I have used React for dynamic updates and a smooth user experience.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED 
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.REACT
4.JAVASCRIPT
5.JSON (for managing data)
6.GIT and GITHUB

## BASIC OPERATION

### Viewing Bots

Upon loading the application, users are presented with a list of available bots fetched from a local db.json file. Each bot displays key information such as name, avatar, health, damage, armor, and class.

### Interacting with BOTS
    1.BOT SELECTION
    Users can click on a bot from the collection to view more detailed information about it. The bot can then be enlisted into the user's army.

    2.BOT ARMY MANAGEMENT
    After enlisting bots into the army, users can view and manage their selection. Bots can be released back to the collection, maintaining their position based on the selected sorting criteria.

    3.SORTING
    Bots can be sorted by various attributes like health, damage, or armor, allowing users to easily compare and manage their army.
